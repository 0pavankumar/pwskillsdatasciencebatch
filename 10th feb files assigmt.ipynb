    "1.To free up system resources: When a file is opened, the operating system assigns resources to handle the file. If a file is not closed after use, these resources will continue to be allocated until the program terminates or the file is closed. This can lead to resource exhaustion, which can cause problems for the operating system and other applications.\n",
